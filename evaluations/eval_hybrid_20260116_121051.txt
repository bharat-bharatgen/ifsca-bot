================================================================================
Question 7 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
I am a "Legal Consultancy" firm authorized under the Ancillary Framework. Am I eligible for the "FinTech Start-up Grant"?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
No. The Incentive Scheme  restricts eligibility to a "FinTech Entity (FE)". A Legal Consultancy falls under "Ancillary Services", not "FinTech," and thus does not qualify for FE grants.

----------------------------------------
LightRAG Response (latency: 5209ms):
----------------------------------------
No.  
The FinTech Start‑up Grant is specifically for **FinTech start‑ups** that develop an MVP and go‑to‑market initiatives under the IFSCA Sandbox (grant of ₹15 lacs with tranches at M1, M2, M3). A “Legal Consultancy” firm is not listed among the services permitted under the Ancillary Framework (the second schedule lists services such as Accelerators, Agri‑Tech, Big‑Data, etc., but does not include legal consultancy). Therefore, a legal‑consultancy firm authorized under the Ancillary Framework does not meet the eligibility criteria for the FinTech Start‑up Grant.

----------------------------------------

================================================================================
Question 9 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
What is the difference between a "Regulatory Sandbox" and an "Innovation Sandbox" in the context of IFSCA?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Regulatory Sandbox: Live environment with real customers/data where regulations are relaxed .Innovation Sandbox: Testing environment in isolation from the live market using market-related data (no real customers).

----------------------------------------
LightRAG Response (latency: 7403ms):
----------------------------------------
**Regulatory Sandbox**  
- A live testing environment that allows FinTech entities to experiment with new products or services while operating under a *Limited‑Use Authorization*.  
- The sandbox permits the use of real customers (though in a limited, controlled manner) and is part of the FinTech Incentive Scheme.  
- It is the higher‑tier sandbox that FinTechs can enter after completing the preliminary testing phase.  

**Innovation Sandbox (FIS)**  
- A controlled, pre‑live testing environment that provides market‑data access but does **not** involve real customers.  
- It is intended for early‑stage experimentation and is separate from the live market.  
- Successful exit from the Innovation Sandbox is a prerequisite for eligibility to apply for the higher‑tier Regulatory Sandbox.  

**Key difference**  
- **Customer exposure**: Regulatory Sandbox allows limited real‑customer interaction; Innovation Sandbox does not.  
- **Stage of development**: Innovation Sandbox is the initial, controlled testing phase; Regulatory Sandbox is the subsequent, live‑market‑ready phase.

----------------------------------------

Question 13 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
I am a "Ship Broker" authorized under the April 2023 Circular. Do I qualify as a "TechFin Provider" under the new 2025 Regulations?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
No. You qualify as an Ancillary Service Provider. • Hop 1: Circular 2023 classifies Ship Broking as "Ancillary".• Hop 2: 2025 Regulations separate "Ancillary" (First Schedule) from "TechFin" (Second Schedule).

----------------------------------------
LightRAG Response (latency: 2578ms):
----------------------------------------
No.  
Under the **International Financial Services Centres Authority (TechFin and Ancillary Services) Regulations, 2025**, a ship broker (or voice broker) is classified as an **Ancillary Service** and is explicitly **not** considered a TechFin Provider.

Question 14 [chatbot]:
================================================================================

Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Yes. • Hop 1: Incentive Scheme lists "Green FinTech Grant".• Hop 2: FAQs on Milestones (Part B) lists "Hardware, IT equipment, servers" as Permissible Expenses for reimbursement.

----------------------------------------
LightRAG Response (latency: 7017ms):

No.  
The Green FinTech Grant is a **grant** that provides up to ₹75 lacs in staged disbursements for developing green fintech solutions. It does not include a reimbursement component for hardware or IT expenses.  

Hardware and server costs are covered under a separate **Hardware/IT Expenses Reimbursable** category, which is a reimbursement scheme for laptop, server, software, and other IT-related expenditures. This category is not part of the Green FinTech Grant.

Question 15 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
Which is more expensive over 2 years: A "Foreign Sandbox" entity (Limited Use) or a "Domestic FinTech" entity (Standard Authorization)?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Domestic FinTech is more expensive. • Hop 1 (Foreign): App($100) + Auth($500) + Ext($500) = **$1,100**.• Hop 2 (Domestic): App($500) + Auth($1,500 x 2) = $3,500.• Hop 3: Compare $3,500 > $1,100.

Question 17 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
I am a "Voice Broker" from a jurisdiction listed on the FATF "High-Risk" list. Can I apply for the "FinTech Start-up Grant"?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
No. • Hop 1: Voice Broking is an Ancillary Service (Circular 2023).• Hop 2: Ancillary Services are now governed by TechFin Regs 2025.• Hop 3: Regs 2025 (Snippet) mandates notifying/restricts FATF High-Risk jurisdictions.• Hop 4: Incentive Scheme requires "Fit and Proper" status; FATF listing likely disqualifies.

----------------------------------------
LightRAG Response (latency: 5754ms):
----------------------------------------
No.  
The FinTech Start‑up Grant is intended for **FinTech start‑ups** that are regulated under the IFSCA FinTech framework. A “Voice Broker” is not a TechFin provider and is not covered by the FinTech framework. Additionally, entities from jurisdictions listed on the FATF “High‑Risk” list are generally excluded from the incentive scheme.  

**Sources**  
- Voice Broker is not considered a TechFin provider (Voice Broking for Banking Services).  
- FinTech Start‑up Grant is awarded to FinTech start‑ups under the IFSCA Sandbox.  
- FATF high‑risk jurisdictions are disallowed for the incentive scheme.

Question 18 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
If I apply for an "Accelerator Grant" today, can I use the funds to pay for "Legal Consultancy" services provided by a firm in Mumbai (outside IFSC)?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Yes, but restricted. • Hop 1: Incentive Scheme defines "Accelerator Grant".• Hop 2: FAQs on Milestones lists "Consultancy fees" as permissible.• Hop 3: FE Framework allows sourcing services from outside, BUT...• Hop 4: Payment must be for eligible expenses. If the consultancy is for the project in IFSC, it is reimbursable. The "Mumbai" location is not a hard block for vendors, only for the applicant's registration.
