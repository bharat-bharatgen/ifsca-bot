================================================================================
Question 1 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
I am an existing Ancillary Service Provider authorised under the February 2021 circular. Do I need to re-register under the new 2025 Regulations?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Yes. According to Regulation 20(3) of the TechFin Regulations 2025, existing providers must obtain a new certificate of registration within 12 months (extendable to 24 months). The 2021 circular is repealed after 24 months. 

----------------------------------------
LightRAG Response (latency: 15885ms):
----------------------------------------
Yes.  
Under the **International Financial Services Centres Authority (TechFin and Ancillary Services) Regulations, 2025** (Chapter II – Registration), an existing Ancillary Service Provider that was authorised under the February 10 2021 circular must obtain a new certificate of registration within **12 months from the commencement of the 2025 Regulations**.  

If the provider cannot obtain the certificate within that period, the Chairperson of the Authority may grant an extension, but the extension cannot exceed **24 months in aggregate** (Source: *International Financial Services Centres Authority (TechFin and Ancillary Services) Regulations, 2025* | Chapter II, Section 4 | “Existing Ancillary Service Provider … Re‑registration Deadline: 12 months from commencement of these regulations” and “Extension shall not exceed twenty‑four (24) months in aggregate”).  

Until a certificate of registration under the 2025 Regulations is issued, the provider continues to be governed by the earlier framework until the 12‑month period (or any granted extension) lapses.

Question 2 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
What is the maximum grant amount available under the 'Green FinTech Grant' and what is it for?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
INR 7.5 Million (Rs 75 Lakhs). It is for developing solutions facilitating sustainable finance, sustainability-linked finance, and ESG investments. 

----------------------------------------
LightRAG Response (latency: 5055ms):
----------------------------------------
The **Green FinTech Grant** offers a maximum award of **₹75 lacs (₹7.5 million)**.  
It is intended to **support the development of solutions that facilitate sustainable finance and sustainability‑linked finance, including ESG (environmental, social and governance) investments**.

================================================================================
Question 3 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
Which is more expensive in terms of "Authorization Fees" over a 5-year period: a 'FinTech Entity' or an 'Ancillary Service Provider'?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
FinTech Entity is more expensive. • FinTech Entity: USD 1,500 per annum × 5 = USD 7,500 .• Ancillary Service: USD 2,000 for a block of 5 years.• Difference: FinTech is USD 5,500 more expensive.

----------------------------------------
LightRAG Response (latency: 9585ms):
----------------------------------------
**FinTech Entity**

- Authorization fee: USD 1,500 per year  
- 5‑year period: 5 × 1,500 = USD 7,500  
- Application fee (one‑time): USD 500  
- **Total over 5 years:** USD 8,000  

(Source: reference_id 2 | 2022‑23 | Fee Summary)

**Ancillary Service Provider**

- Registration fee: USD 2,000 for a 5‑year term  
- Application fee (one‑time): USD 500  
- **Total over 5 years:** USD 2,500  

(Source: reference_id 4 | 2021‑22 | Fee Summary)

**Conclusion**

A **FinTech Entity** incurs higher Authorization Fees over a 5‑year period (USD 8,000) compared to an **Ancillary Service Provider** (USD 2,500).

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 4 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
Can a registered TechFin Service Provider offer "Transport and Logistics services" to its clients within GIFT City?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
No. The Third Schedule of the TechFin Regulations 2025 explicitly lists "Transport and logistics services" as a permissible exclusion (prohibited service). 

----------------------------------------
LightRAG Response (latency: 37935ms):
----------------------------------------
The provided IFSCA documents do not contain sufficient information to answer whether a registered TechFin Service Provider can offer Transport and Logistics services to its clients within GIFT City.

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 5 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
What is the specific SWIFT Code for remitting the application fees for an Ancillary Service Provider?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
SBININBB255 (State Bank of India).

----------------------------------------
LightRAG Response (latency: 13819ms):
----------------------------------------
The application fee for an Ancillary Service Provider is remitted in US Dollars, and the SWIFT code to use is **ICICINAAXXX** (ICICI Bank Limited, USD account).

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 6 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
I am a TechFin company operating in GIFT City. Can I maintain my official balance sheet in Indian Rupees (INR)?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
No. Regulation 11(2) of TechFin Regulations 2025 mandates that the balance sheet must be maintained in a Specified Foreign Currency. INR is permitted only for administrative/statutory expenses.

----------------------------------------
LightRAG Response (latency: 6174ms):
----------------------------------------
No.  
Under the IFSCA regulations, a TechFin entity **must maintain its balance sheet in a specified foreign currency** (e.g., USD, EUR, JPY, etc.) and may not keep it in Indian Rupee. The balance‑sheet currency must be a “specified foreign currency” and “cannot be maintained in INR” (Regulations / Framework documents).  

However, a TechFin entity may open an INR account to defray administrative and statutory expenses, but that account is separate from the balance‑sheet reporting currency.

================================================================================
Question 7 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
I am a "Legal Consultancy" firm authorized under the Ancillary Framework. Am I eligible for the "FinTech Start-up Grant"?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
No. The Incentive Scheme  restricts eligibility to a "FinTech Entity (FE)". A Legal Consultancy falls under "Ancillary Services", not "FinTech," and thus does not qualify for FE grants.

----------------------------------------
LightRAG Response (latency: 21429ms):
----------------------------------------
No.  
The FinTech Start‑up Grant is part of the **IFSCA FinTech Incentive Scheme, 2022**, which is designed exclusively for **FinTech Entities (FEs)** that are authorized under the FE framework (or are part of the Authority’s regulatory/innovation sandbox, an IFSCA‑recognised accelerator, etc.). A “Legal Consultancy” firm that is only authorized under the Ancillary Services framework is not a FinTech Entity and therefore does not meet the eligibility criteria for the grant.  

**Sources**  
- FinTech Incentive Scheme, 2022 – “Eligible Applicants … Part of the Authority’s Regulatory or Innovation Sandbox; or Referred to by entity(ies) …; or Participated/participating in any Accelerator or Cohort or Special Programme supported/recognised by IFSCA; or Referred by an entity having MoU.” (Scheme eligibility)

Question 8 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
If my promoter's home jurisdiction is suddenly identified as "High-Risk" by FATF, within how many days must I notify the Authority?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
10 business days from the date of publication by FATF.

----------------------------------------
LightRAG Response (latency: 5324ms):
----------------------------------------
If a promoter’s home jurisdiction is newly identified by FATF as a “High‑Risk” jurisdiction, the entity must notify the Authority **within 10 business days** from the FATF publication date.

================================================================================
Question 9 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
What is the difference between a "Regulatory Sandbox" and an "Innovation Sandbox" in the context of IFSCA?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Regulatory Sandbox: Live environment with real customers/data where regulations are relaxed .Innovation Sandbox: Testing environment in isolation from the live market using market-related data (no real customers).

----------------------------------------
LightRAG Response (latency: 11127ms):
----------------------------------------
**Regulatory Sandbox (FRS)**  
- A *live* testing environment that allows a FinTech entity to develop and test its solution with a **limited set of real customers** for a limited period.  
- During the sandbox, the entity is granted certain regulatory exemptions/relaxations to facilitate experimentation.  
- It is the sandbox that a FinTech entity enters after exiting the Innovation Sandbox and is the environment in which a *Limited‑Use Authorization* is granted.  

(Source: *Framework for FinTech Entity in the International Financial Services Centres* | 27‑Apr‑2022 | Page 3‑5 – definition of “Regulatory Sandbox” and description of “Regulatory Sandbox (FRS)”)  

**Innovation Sandbox (FIS)**  
- An *isolated* testing environment where a FinTech entity can experiment with its idea or product **without involving real customers**.  
- The sandbox provides market‑related data from regulated entities in the IFSC but does not expose the solution to live market participants.  
- It is the preliminary sandbox that a FinTech entity must pass through before it can apply for the Regulatory Sandbox.  

(Source: *Framework for FinTech Entity in the International Financial Services Centres* | 27‑Apr‑2022 | Page 3‑5 – definition of “Innovation Sandbox” and description of “Innovation Sandbox (FIS)”)  

**Key difference**  
- **Regulatory Sandbox** = live, real‑customer testing with regulatory relaxations.  
- **Innovation Sandbox** = isolated, data‑driven testing with no real‑customer exposure.

Question 10 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
To claim the first 25% disbursement of the 'Listing Support Grant', what specific document must be submitted?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Draft Offer Document. Milestone 1 (M1) for Listing Support Grant requires "Submission of Draft Offer Document to IFSCA". 

----------------------------------------
LightRAG Response (latency: 10083ms):
----------------------------------------
To obtain the first 25 % of the Listing Support Grant, the applicant must submit **proof of successful listing on an IFSCA‑recognised exchange** (i.e., evidence that the FinTech Entity has been listed).

================================================================================
Question 11 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
What is the "Application Fee" for a Foreign FinTech Applicant seeking entry into the IFSCA Regulatory Sandbox?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
USD 100. (Source: FE Framework 2022, Annexure-VIII).

----------------------------------------
LightRAG Response (latency: 10713ms):
----------------------------------------
The application fee for a foreign FinTech applicant seeking entry into the IFSCA Regulatory Sandbox is **USD 100**.  

(Source: Annexure VIII | April 27, 2022 | Fee Structure for IFSCA FinTech Regulatory/Innovation Sandbox – Foreign FinTech Applicants)

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 12 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
According to the 2025 Amendment to the Ancillary Services Framework, are "Family Investment Funds (FIF)" covered under Trusteeship Services?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Yes. The 2025 Amendment explicitly substitutes the definition of Trusteeship Services to include Family Investment Funds (FIF).

----------------------------------------
LightRAG Response (latency: 6157ms):
----------------------------------------
Yes.  
The 2025 amendment to the Ancillary Services Framework (Circular eF No. 51/IFSCA/PFPS0ANCI/1/2020‑21, 17 April 2025) explicitly expands the scope of Trusteeship Services to include **Family Investment Funds (FIF)**.  

> “(a) Trusteeship Services in relation to:  
> – Alternative Investment Funds  
> – Investment Trusts  
> – **Family Investment Funds (FIF)**  
> – Security Trust arrangements  
> – Any other related services, including acting as escrow agent” (Clause 4.3, Annexure I)  

(Source: Circular eF No. 51/IFSCA/PFPS0ANCI/1/2020‑21, 17 April 2025 – Amendment to the Ancillary Services Framework)

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 13 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
I am a "Ship Broker" authorized under the April 2023 Circular. Do I qualify as a "TechFin Provider" under the new 2025 Regulations?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
No. You qualify as an Ancillary Service Provider. • Hop 1: Circular 2023 classifies Ship Broking as "Ancillary".• Hop 2: 2025 Regulations separate "Ancillary" (First Schedule) from "TechFin" (Second Schedule).

----------------------------------------
LightRAG Response (latency: 8939ms):
----------------------------------------
No.  
Under the 2025 Regulations a **TechFin Provider** is an entity that has been granted registration for providing one or more of the *TechFin Services* listed in the Second Schedule. A **Ship Broker** (or Voice Broker) is classified as an **Ancillary Service** under the First Schedule and is explicitly stated to **not** be a TechFin Provider.

- The 2025 Regulations define a TechFin and Ancillary Service Provider as an entity registered for providing either Ancillary Services or TechFin Services (First/Second Schedule)【1】.  
- The same Regulations state that a Ship Broker / Voice Broker is classified as an Ancillary Service and is **not** a TechFin Provider【1】.

Therefore, being authorized as a Ship Broker under the April 2023 Circular does not qualify you as a TechFin Provider under the new 2025 Regulations.

================================================================================
Question 14 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
Can I claim reimbursement for "Laptop and Server" costs under the "Green FinTech Grant"?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Yes. • Hop 1: Incentive Scheme lists "Green FinTech Grant".• Hop 2: FAQs on Milestones (Part B) lists "Hardware, IT equipment, servers" as Permissible Expenses for reimbursement.

----------------------------------------
LightRAG Response (latency: 7700ms):
----------------------------------------
Yes.  
Under the Green FinTech Grant, “Hardware/IT Expenses Reimbursable” is a permissible expense category, and it explicitly lists **laptop and server costs** as reimbursable items. The grant is paid on a reimbursement basis, so you can submit invoices for laptops and servers that are directly related to the project you are applying for.

(Source: FAQs on Milestones & Illustrative Permissible Expenses for Reimbursement | 2022‑12‑15 | Page 6‑8)

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 15 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
Which is more expensive over 2 years: A "Foreign Sandbox" entity (Limited Use) or a "Domestic FinTech" entity (Standard Authorization)?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Domestic FinTech is more expensive. • Hop 1 (Foreign): App($100) + Auth($500) + Ext($500) = **$1,100**.• Hop 2 (Domestic): App($500) + Auth($1,500 x 2) = $3,500.• Hop 3: Compare $3,500 > $1,100.

----------------------------------------
LightRAG Response (latency: 15745ms):
----------------------------------------
**Cost comparison over a 2‑year period**

| Entity | Fee components (per the IFSCA fee circular) | Total cost over 2 years |
|--------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Domestic FinTech – Standard Authorization** (Direct Authorization) | • Application fee: USD 500 (one‑time)  <br>• Authorization/Testing fee: USD 1,500 **annual** | USD 500 + 2 × USD 1,500 = **USD 3,500** |
| **Foreign Sandbox – Limited‑Use Authorization** (Sandbox) | • Application fee: USD 100 (one‑time)  <br>• Authorization/Testing fee: USD 500 (one‑time)  <br>• Extension fee: USD 500 per 6‑month extension (sandbox lasts 12 months, extendable by 6 months) | USD 100 + USD 500 + 2 × USD 500 = **USD 1,600** |

**Conclusion**

A foreign entity operating under a Limited‑Use Authorization in the sandbox is considerably cheaper over a 2‑year horizon (USD 1,600) than a domestic FinTech entity with a Standard (Direct) Authorization (USD 3,500).

Question 16 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
I have an "In-Principle" approval for the Listing Support Grant. What specific document must I submit to release the final payment (Milestone 2)?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Proof of successful listing on the Stock Exchange. • Hop 1: Incentive Scheme identifies "Listing Support Grant".• Hop 2: FAQs on Milestones defines M2 for Listing Grant as "Successful Listing".• Hop 3: Document required is implied/stated as proof thereof.

----------------------------------------
LightRAG Response (latency: 8935ms):
----------------------------------------
To obtain the final (M2) payment under the Listing Support Grant you must submit **proof of successful listing on a stock exchange that is recognized by IFSCA**.

================================================================================
Question 17 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
I am a "Voice Broker" from a jurisdiction listed on the FATF "High-Risk" list. Can I apply for the "FinTech Start-up Grant"?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
No. • Hop 1: Voice Broking is an Ancillary Service (Circular 2023).• Hop 2: Ancillary Services are now governed by TechFin Regs 2025.• Hop 3: Regs 2025 (Snippet) mandates notifying/restricts FATF High-Risk jurisdictions.• Hop 4: Incentive Scheme requires "Fit and Proper" status; FATF listing likely disqualifies.

----------------------------------------
LightRAG Response (latency: 8199ms):
----------------------------------------
No.  

**Reasons**

| Requirement | Source | Explanation |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| **Applicant must be a FinTech Entity (FE)** | (8) *FinTech Incentive Scheme, 2022 – Eligibility* – “The scheme is open to … FinTech Entities …” | A Voice Broker is an ancillary service provider, not a FinTech Entity. |
| **FATF‑compliant jurisdiction** | (8) *FinTech Incentive Scheme, 2022 – Eligibility* – “All promoters or partners of the applicant entity shall be from a jurisdiction which has not been identified in the public statement of FATF as ‘High‑Risk Jurisdictions subject to call for action’.” | Your jurisdiction is listed on the FATF High‑Risk list, so the applicant fails this criterion. |
| **Service type** | (7) *First Schedule – List of Permitted Ancillary Services* – “Voice broking for banking services” is listed as an ancillary service, not a FinTech activity. | The scheme is for FinTech activities; ancillary services are outside its scope. |

Because the applicant does not meet the FATF‑compliance requirement and is not a FinTech Entity, it is ineligible for the FinTech Start‑up Grant.

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 18 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
If I apply for an "Accelerator Grant" today, can I use the funds to pay for "Legal Consultancy" services provided by a firm in Mumbai (outside IFSC)?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Yes, but restricted. • Hop 1: Incentive Scheme defines "Accelerator Grant".• Hop 2: FAQs on Milestones lists "Consultancy fees" as permissible.• Hop 3: FE Framework allows sourcing services from outside, BUT...• Hop 4: Payment must be for eligible expenses. If the consultancy is for the project in IFSC, it is reimbursable. The "Mumbai" location is not a hard block for vendors, only for the applicant's registration.
