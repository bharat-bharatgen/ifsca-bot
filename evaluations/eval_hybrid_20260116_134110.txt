Question 1 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
I am an existing Ancillary Service Provider authorised under the February 2021 circular. Do I need to re-register under the new 2025 Regulations?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Yes. According to Regulation 20(3) of the TechFin Regulations 2025, existing providers must obtain a new certificate of registration within 12 months (extendable to 24 months). The 2021 circular is repealed after 24 months. 

----------------------------------------
LightRAG Response (latency: 6273ms):
----------------------------------------
Yes.  
Under the **International Financial Services Centres Authority (TechFin and Ancillary Services) Regulations, 2025** (Notification IFSCA/GN/2025/005), an existing Ancillary Service Provider that was authorised under the February 10 2021 circular must obtain a new certificate of registration within **12 months from the commencement of the 2025 Regulations** (unless an extension of up to 24 months in aggregate is granted by the Chairperson).  

The 2025 Regulations supersede the earlier 2021 framework for all ancillary service providers, so re‑registration is mandatory to continue operating under the new regime.

Question 3 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
Which is more expensive in terms of "Authorization Fees" over a 5-year period: a 'FinTech Entity' or an 'Ancillary Service Provider'?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
FinTech Entity is more expensive. • FinTech Entity: USD 1,500 per annum × 5 = USD 7,500 .• Ancillary Service: USD 2,000 for a block of 5 years.• Difference: FinTech is USD 5,500 more expensive.

----------------------------------------
LightRAG Response (latency: 9827ms):
----------------------------------------
**Authorization fees over a 5‑year period**

| Entity | Annual Authorization fee | 5‑year total (excluding application fee) |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| FinTech Entity | USD 1,500 | USD 7,500 |
| Ancillary Service Provider | USD 2,000 (fixed for 5 years) | USD 2,000 |

**Result**

A **FinTech Entity** incurs a higher total authorization cost over five years (USD 7,500) compared with an Ancillary Service Provider (USD 2,000).

**Sources**

- FinTech Entity fees: “Authorization Fee – USD 1,500 (Annual)” (Fee Summary, FE Framework, 2022‑23) (Source: reference_id 2 | 2022‑23 | Fee Summary).

Question 4 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
Can a registered TechFin Service Provider offer "Transport and Logistics services" to its clients within GIFT City?

----------------------------------------

Question 6 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
I am a TechFin company operating in GIFT City. Can I maintain my official balance sheet in Indian Rupees (INR)?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
No. Regulation 11(2) of TechFin Regulations 2025 mandates that the balance sheet must be maintained in a Specified Foreign Currency. INR is permitted only for administrative/statutory expenses.

----------------------------------------
LightRAG Response (latency: 8613ms):
----------------------------------------

================================================================================
Question 7 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
I am a "Legal Consultancy" firm authorized under the Ancillary Framework. Am I eligible for the "FinTech Start-up Grant"?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
No. The Incentive Scheme  restricts eligibility to a "FinTech Entity (FE)". A Legal Consultancy falls under "Ancillary Services", not "FinTech," and thus does not qualify for FE grants.

----------------------------------------
LightRAG Response (latency: 11844ms):
----------------------------------------
No.  
The FinTech Start‑up Grant is only available to **FinTech Entities (FEs) that are authorized under the FE Framework** and that meet the scheme’s eligibility criteria (e.g., participation in a regulatory/innovation sandbox, an accelerator, or a referral arrangement). A firm that is authorized only under the Ancillary Services Framework is an Ancillary Service Provider, not a FinTech Entity, and therefore does not satisfy the eligibility requirement for the grant.  

(Source: 29‑ifsca‑fintech‑incentive‑scheme‑202225042022010125.en.md | 2022‑04‑10 | Eligibility section – “Applicant must be a FinTech Entity (FE) authorized under the FE Framework.”)

================================================================================
Question 8 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
If my promoter's home jurisdiction is suddenly identified as "High-Risk" by FATF, within how many days must I notify the Authority?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
10 business days from the date of publication by FATF.

----------------------------------------
LightRAG Response (latency: 5725ms):
----------------------------------------
If a promoter’s home jurisdiction is newly identified by FATF as a “High‑Risk” jurisdiction, the entity must notify the Authority **within 10 business days** from the FATF publication date (as per Fourth Schedule (iii) of the International Financial Services Centres Authority (TechFin and Ancillary Services) Regulations, 2025).  

(Source: IFSCA_TAS__Regulations__2025_20250807_0557.en.md | Section on FATF High‑Risk Notification | Fourth Schedule (iii))

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 9 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
What is the difference between a "Regulatory Sandbox" and an "Innovation Sandbox" in the context of IFSCA?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Regulatory Sandbox: Live environment with real customers/data where regulations are relaxed .Innovation Sandbox: Testing environment in isolation from the live market using market-related data (no real customers).

----------------------------------------
LightRAG Response (latency: 10422ms):
----------------------------------------
**Regulatory Sandbox (FRS)**  
- A *live* testing environment that allows a FinTech entity to develop and test its product or service with a **limited set of real customers** for a limited period.  
- During the sandbox, the entity may receive certain regulatory exemptions or relaxations that would normally apply in the broader market.  
- The sandbox is intended for real‑world experimentation and is the higher‑tier environment that a FinTech can move into after successful exit from the Innovation Sandbox.  

(Source: *Framework for FinTech Entity in the International Financial Services Centres* – definitions, page 3‑5; *IFSCA FinTech Regulatory Sandbox (FRS)* – description, page 6‑8)

**Innovation Sandbox (FIS)**  
- A *controlled* testing environment that is **isolated from the live market**.  
- FinTech entities can test ideas and solutions using market‑related data provided by regulated entities in the IFSC, but no real customers are involved.  
- It serves as a preliminary stage for product development before a FinTech seeks entry into the Regulatory Sandbox.  

(Source: *Framework for FinTech Entity in the International Financial Services Centres* – definitions, page 3‑5; *IFSCA FinTech Innovation Sandbox (FIS)* – description, page 6‑8)

**Key difference**  
- **Customer exposure**: Regulatory Sandbox involves real customers; Innovation Sandbox does not.  
- **Market integration**: Regulatory Sandbox is a live market test; Innovation Sandbox is a sandboxed, data‑driven test.  
- **Progression**: A FinTech typically moves from the Innovation Sandbox to the Regulatory Sandbox after demonstrating viability.

================================================================================
Question 12 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
According to the 2025 Amendment to the Ancillary Services Framework, are "Family Investment Funds (FIF)" covered under Trusteeship Services?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Yes. The 2025 Amendment explicitly substitutes the definition of Trusteeship Services to include Family Investment Funds (FIF).

----------------------------------------
LightRAG Response (latency: 7053ms):
----------------------------------------
Yes.  
The 2025 amendment to the Ancillary Services Framework (Circular eF No. 51/IFSCA/PFPS0ANCI/1/2020‑21, 17 April 2025) explicitly adds “Family Investment Funds (FIF)” to the list of entities covered under Trusteeship Services.  

> **Clause 4.3 (Amended)** – Trusteeship Services in relation to:  
> - Alternative Investment Funds  
> - Investment Trusts  
> - **Family Investment Funds (FIF)**  
> - Security Trust arrangements  
> - …

================================================================================
Question 13 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
I am a "Ship Broker" authorized under the April 2023 Circular. Do I qualify as a "TechFin Provider" under the new 2025 Regulations?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
No. You qualify as an Ancillary Service Provider. • Hop 1: Circular 2023 classifies Ship Broking as "Ancillary".• Hop 2: 2025 Regulations separate "Ancillary" (First Schedule) from "TechFin" (Second Schedule).

----------------------------------------
LightRAG Response (latency: 6729ms):
----------------------------------------
No.  
Under the International Financial Services Centres Authority (TechFin and Ancillary Services) Regulations, 2025, a **Ship Broker (or Voice Broker)** is classified as an **Ancillary Service Provider** and is explicitly stated to **not** be a TechFin Provider.  

(Source: IFSCA_TAS__Regulations__2025_20250807_0557.en.md | Section on “Ship Broker / Voice Broker” – “Classified as Ancillary Service (First Schedule (xx), (xxiv)), NOT TechFin Provider.”)

================================================================================
Question 14 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
Can I claim reimbursement for "Laptop and Server" costs under the "Green FinTech Grant"?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Yes. • Hop 1: Incentive Scheme lists "Green FinTech Grant".• Hop 2: FAQs on Milestones (Part B) lists "Hardware, IT equipment, servers" as Permissible Expenses for reimbursement.

----------------------------------------
LightRAG Response (latency: 6427ms):
----------------------------------------
Yes.  
The Green FinTech Grant allows reimbursement of expenses that fall under the **Hardware/IT Expenses Reimbursable** category, which explicitly includes laptop and server costs.  

(Source: <FAQs on Milestones & Illustrative Permissible Expenses for Reimbursement> | 2022‑02‑15 | “Hardware, Software and Information Technology related” includes laptop and server)

Question 15 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
Which is more expensive over 2 years: A "Foreign Sandbox" entity (Limited Use) or a "Domestic FinTech" entity (Standard Authorization)?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Domestic FinTech is more expensive. • Hop 1 (Foreign): App($100) + Auth($500) + Ext($500) = **$1,100**.• Hop 2 (Domestic): App($500) + Auth($1,500 x 2) = $3,500.• Hop 3: Compare $3,500 > $1,100.

----------------------------------------
LightRAG Response (latency: 13043ms):
----------------------------------------
**Cost comparison (USD)**  

| Entity | Application fee | Annual/periodic fee | Extension fee (if needed) | Total for 2 years |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| Domestic FinTech – Standard Authorization | USD 500 | USD 1,500 × 2 years | – | **USD 3,500** |
| Foreign Sandbox – Limited‑Use Authorization | USD 100 | USD 500 × 12 months | USD 500 (for the 6‑month extension) | **USD 1,100** |

**Explanation**

1. **Domestic FinTech (Standard Authorization)**  
   * Application fee: USD 500 (Framework fee summary)  
   * Annual authorization fee: USD 1,500 per year (Framework fee summary)  
   * Over two years: 500 + (1,500 × 2) = 3,500 USD.  
   * Source: *Framework for FinTech Entity* – Fee Summary (April 27 2022) (Source: reference 2).

2. **Foreign Sandbox (Limited‑Use Authorization)**  
   * Application fee: USD 100 (Framework fee summary)  
   * Authorization/Testing fee for the 12‑month sandbox: USD 500 (Framework fee summary)  
   * Sandbox duration is 12 months and can be extended by 6 months (Framework fee summary).  
   * Extension fee for the additional 6 months: USD 500 (Framework fee summary).  
   * Total for 24 months: 100 + 500 + 500 = 1,100 USD.  
   * Source: *Framework for FinTech Entity* – Fee Summary and sandbox duration (Source: reference 2).

**Result**

The **Domestic FinTech entity with Standard Authorization** is more expensive over a 2‑year period (USD 3,500) compared with a **Foreign Sandbox entity with Limited‑Use Authorization** (USD 1,100).

Question 16 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
I have an "In-Principle" approval for the Listing Support Grant. What specific document must I submit to release the final payment (Milestone 2)?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Proof of successful listing on the Stock Exchange. • Hop 1: Incentive Scheme identifies "Listing Support Grant".• Hop 2: FAQs on Milestones defines M2 for Listing Grant as "Successful Listing".• Hop 3: Document required is implied/stated as proof thereof.

----------------------------------------
LightRAG Response (latency: 8869ms):
----------------------------------------

================================================================================
Question 17 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
I am a "Voice Broker" from a jurisdiction listed on the FATF "High-Risk" list. Can I apply for the "FinTech Start-up Grant"?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
No. • Hop 1: Voice Broking is an Ancillary Service (Circular 2023).• Hop 2: Ancillary Services are now governed by TechFin Regs 2025.• Hop 3: Regs 2025 (Snippet) mandates notifying/restricts FATF High-Risk jurisdictions.• Hop 4: Incentive Scheme requires "Fit and Proper" status; FATF listing likely disqualifies.

----------------------------------------
LightRAG Response (latency: 7467ms):
----------------------------------------
No.  

**Why not?**  

| Reason | Source |
|--------|--------|
| The FinTech Incentive Scheme is only open to **FinTech Entities** (or entities that are part of a recognized accelerator/cohort, etc.). A “Voice Broker” is classified as an **Ancillary Service Provider** (First Schedule – “Voice broking for banking services”) and is not a FinTech or TechFin entity. | (FinTech Incentive Scheme, 2022 – Eligibility section) |
| Applicants must be from a **FATF‑compliant jurisdiction**. The scheme explicitly states that promoters or partners must **not** be from a jurisdiction identified by FATF as a “High‑Risk Jurisdiction subject to call for action.” | (FinTech Incentive Scheme, 2022 – Eligibility section) |
| Therefore, a Voice Broker from a FATF‑high‑risk jurisdiction does not meet the eligibility criteria for the FinTech Start‑up Grant. | (FinTech Incentive Scheme, 2022 – Eligibility section) |

> **Conclusion:** A Voice Broker from a FATF‑high‑risk jurisdiction cannot apply for the FinTech Start‑up Grant.

Question 18 [chatbot]:
================================================================================
If I apply for an "Accelerator Grant" today, can I use the funds to pay for "Legal Consultancy" services provided by a firm in Mumbai (outside IFSC)?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Yes, but restricted. • Hop 1: Incentive Scheme defines "Accelerator Grant".• Hop 2: FAQs on Milestones lists "Consultancy fees" as permissible.• Hop 3: FE Framework allows sourcing services from outside, BUT...• Hop 4: Payment must be for eligible expenses. If the consultancy is for the project in IFSC, it is reimbursable. The "Mumbai" location is not a hard block for vendors, only for the applicant's registration.
