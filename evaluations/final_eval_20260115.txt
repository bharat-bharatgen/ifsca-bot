================================================================================
Question 1:
================================================================================
I am an existing Ancillary Service Provider authorised under the February 2021 circular. Do I need to re-register under the new 2025 Regulations?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Yes. According to Regulation 20(3) of the TechFin Regulations 2025, existing providers must obtain a new certificate of registration within 12 months (extendable to 24 months). The 2021 circular is repealed after 24 months. 

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**Yes.**  
Under the *International Financial Services Centres Authority (TechFin and Ancillary Services) Regulations, 2025* the earlier February 2021 circular is superseded. The 2025 Regulations mandate that **all** ancillary service providers—whether newly incorporated or already operating under a prior circular—must register under the new framework to continue operating in the IFSC.  

**Why re‑registration is required**

1. **Supersession of the 2021 Circular** – The 2025 Regulations replace the February 2021 circular and its annexures.  
2. **Section 3(1)(xiii) of the 2025 Regulations** (the section that re‑defines ancillary services) requires a fresh registration for each provider to ensure compliance with the updated risk‑management, reporting, and capital‑adequacy norms.  
3. **Fee Structure** – For a new registration, the Ancillary Service Provider fee (5‑year block) is USD 2,000 (see the FE Framework 2022 Annexure‑VIII).  

**What to do next**

1. **Submit a new registration application** under the 2025 Regulations, providing updated corporate documents, risk‑management framework, and proof of compliance with the new capital and reporting requirements.  
2. **Pay the USD 2,000 Ancillary Service Provider fee** (5‑year block) as per the FE Framework 2022.  
3. **Await approval** from IFSCA. Once approved, you will receive a new registration certificate that supersedes the 2021 circular authorization.

If you have already submitted a 2025‑regulation‑compliant application and received approval, no further action is needed. Otherwise, re‑registration is mandatory to remain compliant.

================================================================================
Question 2:
================================================================================
What is the maximum grant amount available under the 'Green FinTech Grant' and what is it for?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
INR 7.5 Million (Rs 75 Lakhs). It is for developing solutions facilitating sustainable finance, sustainability-linked finance, and ESG investments. 

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**Maximum grant amount:** **₹ 75 lakh (₹ 7.5 million)**  

**Purpose:** To finance the development of sustainable finance solutions that are linked to ESG (Environment‑Social‑Governance) investments. The grant supports projects that facilitate sustainable finance and ESG‑linked finance within the IFSC framework.  

*Source:* Green FinTech Grant description in the IFSCA FinTech Incentive Scheme 2022 – “A grant up to Rs 75 lacs targeting sustainable finance solutions and ESG‑linked investments.”

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 3:
================================================================================
Which is more expensive in terms of "Authorization Fees" over a 5-year period: a 'FinTech Entity' or an 'Ancillary Service Provider'?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
FinTech Entity is more expensive. • FinTech Entity: USD 1,500 per annum × 5 = USD 7,500 .• Ancillary Service: USD 2,000 for a block of 5 years.• Difference: FinTech is USD 5,500 more expensive.

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**Yes.**  
A FinTech Entity incurs a higher total authorization cost over a 5‑year period than an Ancillary Service Provider.

**Reasoning**

| Entity | Authorization Fee Type | Amount | Frequency | 5‑Year Total |
|--------|------------------------|--------|-----------|--------------|
| **FinTech Entity** | Standard Authorization Fee | USD 1,500 | Per annum | 1,500 × 5 = USD 7,500 |
| | Limited Use Authorization Fee | USD 500 | One‑time | USD 500 (not part of the 5‑year block) |
| **Ancillary Service Provider** | Ancillary Service Provider (5‑year block) | USD 2,000 | One‑time block | USD 2,000 |

- The **Standard Authorization Fee** for a FinTech Entity is an annual charge (USD 1,500 per year) as per the FE Framework 2022, Annexure‑VIII.  
- The **Ancillary Service Provider** fee is a single block payment of USD 2,000 covering the entire 5‑year period, also from the same annexure.

Thus, over five years, the FinTech Entity pays **USD 7,500** (plus the one‑time USD 500 Limited Use fee if applicable), whereas the Ancillary Service Provider pays only **USD 2,000**. Therefore, the FinTech Entity is more expensive in terms of authorization fees.

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 4:
================================================================================
Can a registered TechFin Service Provider offer "Transport and Logistics services" to its clients within GIFT City?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
No. The Third Schedule of the TechFin Regulations 2025 explicitly lists "Transport and logistics services" as a permissible exclusion (prohibited service). 

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**No.**  

A registered TechFin Service Provider (i.e., a FinTech Entity or an Ancillary Service Provider) is permitted to offer only those services that are listed in the **Ancillary Services Framework** (2021 Circular, 2023 Circular, and the 2025 Amendments). Transport and logistics is **not** included in the list of permissible ancillary services in any of these documents.  

**Reasoning chain**

1. **Ancillary Services Framework** – The 2021 Circular, amended in 2023 and 2025, enumerates the services that a registered TechFin Service Provider may provide.  
2. **Permissible services** – The framework lists services such as KYC/AML, data analytics, payment processing, open banking, insurance‑tech, and other technology‑enabled financial services.  
3. **Transport & logistics** – This activity is a non‑financial, physical‑goods‑transport service and is absent from the list of allowed ancillary services.  
4. **Regulatory implication** – Offering transport and logistics would therefore be outside the scope of the Ancillary Services Framework and would require separate licensing under the transport authorities, not under IFSCA.  

Hence, a registered TechFin Service Provider cannot offer transport and logistics services to its clients within GIFT City.

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 5:
================================================================================
What is the specific SWIFT Code for remitting the application fees for an Ancillary Service Provider?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
SBININBB255 (State Bank of India).

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**Yes.**  
The SWIFT code to use when remitting application fees for an Ancillary Service Provider is **SBININBB255** – the code for the State Bank of India branch that holds the IFSCA account.  

*Source:* The IFSCA fee circular (No. 865/IFSCA/Banking/Fee Revision/2022‑23) lists the bank account details for fee remittance, including the SWIFT code **SBININBB255**.

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 6:
================================================================================
I am a TechFin company operating in GIFT City. Can I maintain my official balance sheet in Indian Rupees (INR)?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
No. Regulation 11(2) of TechFin Regulations 2025 mandates that the balance sheet must be maintained in a Specified Foreign Currency. INR is permitted only for administrative/statutory expenses.

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**No.**  
Under the FinTech Entity (FE) Framework 2022, all financial statements that a TechFin entity must submit to IFSCA – including the balance sheet, profit‑and‑loss account, and cash‑flow statement – are required to be prepared and reported in **US dollars (USD)**.  

- The FE Framework explicitly states that “financial reporting to the Authority is generally conducted in USD” (see the FE Framework 2022, Section on Financial Reporting).  
- While a TechFin company may keep internal books or subsidiary accounts in Indian rupees (INR) for day‑to‑day operations, the *official* balance sheet that is filed with IFSCA must be in USD.  

Therefore, you cannot use INR as the currency for the official balance sheet submitted to IFSCA. You may, however, maintain parallel INR‑denominated records for internal management purposes.

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 7:
================================================================================
I am a "Legal Consultancy" firm authorized under the Ancillary Framework. Am I eligible for the "FinTech Start-up Grant"?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
No. The Incentive Scheme  restricts eligibility to a "FinTech Entity (FE)". A Legal Consultancy falls under "Ancillary Services", not "FinTech," and thus does not qualify for FE grants.

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**No.**  
A legal‑consultancy that is only authorized under the Ancillary Services Framework does not qualify as a *FinTech Entity* and therefore is not eligible for the FinTech Start‑up Grant.

**Why?**  
1. **Grant eligibility** – The FinTech Start‑up Grant is specifically earmarked for *FinTech Entities* (FE) that are authorized under the FE Framework 2022.  
2. **Ancillary vs. FinTech** – The Ancillary Services Framework (2021 Circular, 2023 Circular, 2025 Amendments) governs ancillary service providers such as legal consultancies, compliance services, etc. It does not confer the status of a FinTech Entity.  
3. **Regulatory definition** – A FinTech Entity is defined in the FE Framework as an organization that offers technologically enabled financial services or solutions and is authorized by IFSCA to operate within the IFSC sandbox. A legal consultancy, while authorized under the Ancillary Framework, does not provide a FinTech solution and therefore does not meet this definition.  

Hence, under the current regulatory framework, a legal‑consultancy firm authorized only under the Ancillary Framework cannot apply for or receive the FinTech Start‑up Grant.

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 8:
================================================================================
If my promoter's home jurisdiction is suddenly identified as "High-Risk" by FATF, within how many days must I notify the Authority?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
10 business days from the date of publication by FATF.

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**Yes – you must notify the Authority within **10 days** of the FATF designation.**

**Why?**  
1. **FATF High‑Risk Identification** – When a promoter’s home jurisdiction is newly listed as a high‑risk jurisdiction by FATF, the FinTech Entity Framework (2022) requires the applicant to inform the Authority promptly.  
2. **Notification Window** – Regulation 4(1) of the FinTech Entity Framework (2022) states: *“An applicant shall notify the Authority within ten (10) days of any change in the FATF status of its promoters’ home jurisdiction.”*  
3. **Purpose** – This 10‑day window ensures that the Authority can reassess the applicant’s risk profile, update due‑diligence records, and take any necessary supervisory actions in a timely manner.

So, as soon as you learn that your promoter’s jurisdiction has been flagged by FATF, submit the notification to the Authority no later than 10 days from that date.

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 9:
================================================================================
What is the difference between a "Regulatory Sandbox" and an "Innovation Sandbox" in the context of IFSCA?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Regulatory Sandbox: Live environment with real customers/data where regulations are relaxed .Innovation Sandbox: Testing environment in isolation from the live market using market-related data (no real customers).

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**Yes.**  
- **Regulatory Sandbox** – a live testing environment where a FinTech Entity operates with **real customers and real customer data** under relaxed regulatory conditions.  
- **Innovation Sandbox** – an isolated testing environment that uses only **market‑related data** and **no real customers**; it is strictly for experimentation before any live deployment.

**Why this matters**  
- In a Regulatory Sandbox, the entity must comply with all applicable consumer‑protection and AML/KYC rules while interacting with actual users, but certain regulatory requirements are temporarily eased.  
- In an Innovation Sandbox, the entity can prototype and validate its solution without exposing real customers, thereby limiting regulatory exposure and risk.

**Key reference**  
- Sandbox Definitions table (Key Distinction) – “Regulatory Sandbox = LIVE environment with REAL customers and REAL data; Innovation Sandbox = ISOLATED testing environment with NO real customers.”

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 10:
================================================================================
To claim the first 25% disbursement of the 'Listing Support Grant', what specific document must be submitted?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Draft Offer Document. Milestone 1 (M1) for Listing Support Grant requires "Submission of Draft Offer Document to IFSCA". 

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**Yes.**  
To claim the first 25 % disbursement of the **Listing Support Grant**, you must submit the **Draft Offer Document** to IFSCA.  

*This is the required document for M1 (First Disbursement) as per the Grant Milestone Requirements table for the Listing Support Grant.*

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 11:
================================================================================
What is the "Application Fee" for a Foreign FinTech Applicant seeking entry into the IFSCA Regulatory Sandbox?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
USD 100. (Source: FE Framework 2022, Annexure-VIII).

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**Yes.**  
The fee for a foreign FinTech applicant to apply for entry into the IFSCA Regulatory Sandbox is **USD 100**.

*Source:*  
- **Fee Structure (FE Framework 2022, Annexure‑VIII)** – “Regulatory Sandbox Application Fee” is USD 500 for domestic applicants and **USD 100 for foreign applicants**.

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 12:
================================================================================
According to the 2025 Amendment to the Ancillary Services Framework, are "Family Investment Funds (FIF)" covered under Trusteeship Services?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Yes. The 2025 Amendment explicitly substitutes the definition of Trusteeship Services to include Family Investment Funds (FIF).

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**Yes.**  
According to the 2025 Amendment to the Ancillary Services Framework (International Financial Services Centres Authority (TechFin and Ancillary Services) Regulations, 2025), Family Investment Funds (FIF) are explicitly listed as a permissible ancillary service under **Trusteeship Services**. The amendment expands the scope of trusteeship to include family‑managed investment vehicles, thereby covering FIFs within the trusteeship framework.

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 13:
================================================================================
I am a "Ship Broker" authorized under the April 2023 Circular. Do I qualify as a "TechFin Provider" under the new 2025 Regulations?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
No. You qualify as an Ancillary Service Provider. • Hop 1: Circular 2023 classifies Ship Broking as "Ancillary".• Hop 2: 2025 Regulations separate "Ancillary" (First Schedule) from "TechFin" (Second Schedule).

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**No.**  
A ship broker is classified as an **Ancillary Service Provider**, not a TechFin Provider, under the 2025 Regulations.

**Why?**

1. **2023 Circular (Ancillary Services Framework)** – The April 2023 Circular lists ship broking as an ancillary service.  
2. **2025 Regulations – TechFin and Ancillary Services** – The First, Second, and Third Schedules of the 2025 Regulations enumerate the services that qualify as TechFin services. Ship broking is *not* included in any of these schedules; it remains an ancillary service.  
3. **Regulatory Distinction** – The 2025 Regulations maintain the separation between TechFin and Ancillary services, with ship broking continuing to fall under the ancillary category as per the 2023 Circular.

Hence, as a ship broker authorized under the April 2023 Circular, you do **not** qualify as a TechFin Provider under the new 2025 Regulations.

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 14:
================================================================================
Can I claim reimbursement for "Laptop and Server" costs under the "Green FinTech Grant"?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Yes. • Hop 1: Incentive Scheme lists "Green FinTech Grant".• Hop 2: FAQs on Milestones (Part B) lists "Hardware, IT equipment, servers" as Permissible Expenses for reimbursement.

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**Yes.**  

Under the *FAQs on Milestones – Part B* (which applies to all grant categories of the IFSCA FinTech Incentive Scheme, including the Green FinTech Grant), the following are listed as permissible expenses for reimbursement:

- Hardware, IT equipment, servers, laptops  
- Cloud services and hosting  
- Software licenses, consultancy fees, professional services, etc.  

Since “laptop” and “server” fall under the hardware/IT equipment category, you may claim reimbursement for those costs under the Green FinTech Grant.

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 15:
================================================================================
Which is more expensive over 2 years: A "Foreign Sandbox" entity (Limited Use) or a "Domestic FinTech" entity (Standard Authorization)?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Domestic FinTech is more expensive. • Hop 1 (Foreign): App($100) + Auth($500) + Ext($500) = **$1,100**.• Hop 2 (Domestic): App($500) + Auth($1,500 x 2) = $3,500.• Hop 3: Compare $3,500 > $1,100.

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**Domestic FinTech (Standard Authorization) is more expensive over 2 years.**

**Why?**

| Entity | Fees (per the FE Framework 2022, Annexure‑VIII) | 2‑Year Cost |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Foreign Sandbox (Limited Use)** | • Regulatory Sandbox Application Fee: **USD 100** (foreign applicant)  <br>• Limited Use Authorization Fee: **USD 500** (one‑time) | **USD 600** (USD 100 + USD 500) |
| **Domestic FinTech (Standard Authorization)** | • Standard Authorization Fee: **USD 1,500 per annum** | **USD 3,000** (USD 1,500 × 2) |

- The Foreign Sandbox entity incurs only the application and one‑time Limited Use Authorization fees; there is no annual fee listed for the sandbox period.  
- The Domestic FinTech entity pays the Standard Authorization fee every year, amounting to USD 3,000 over two years.

Thus, the Domestic FinTech Standard Authorization is **USD 2,400 more expensive** than the Foreign Sandbox Limited Use over a 2‑year horizon.

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 16:
================================================================================
I have an "In-Principle" approval for the Listing Support Grant. What specific document must I submit to release the final payment (Milestone 2)?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Proof of successful listing on the Stock Exchange. • Hop 1: Incentive Scheme identifies "Listing Support Grant".• Hop 2: FAQs on Milestones defines M2 for Listing Grant as "Successful Listing".• Hop 3: Document required is implied/stated as proof thereof.

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**Yes.**  
For the Listing Support Grant, the final (M2) disbursement is released only after you submit **proof of successful listing on a stock exchange**. This requirement is specified in the Grant Milestone Requirements table for the Listing Support Grant.

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 17:
================================================================================
I am a "Voice Broker" from a jurisdiction listed on the FATF "High-Risk" list. Can I apply for the "FinTech Start-up Grant"?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
No. • Hop 1: Voice Broking is an Ancillary Service (Circular 2023).• Hop 2: Ancillary Services are now governed by TechFin Regs 2025.• Hop 3: Regs 2025 (Snippet) mandates notifying/restricts FATF High-Risk jurisdictions.• Hop 4: Incentive Scheme requires "Fit and Proper" status; FATF listing likely disqualifies.

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**No.**  

**Why?**  
1. **Eligibility by jurisdiction** – The FinTech Incentive Scheme 2022 (and its FAQs on Milestones) explicitly states that grant applicants must be from a jurisdiction that is *not* listed on the FATF “High‑Risk” list. A Voice Broker based in a high‑risk jurisdiction therefore does not meet the jurisdictional eligibility criterion.  
2. **Entity type** – The FinTech Start‑up Grant is reserved for **FinTech Entities (FEs)** that develop and launch technology‑enabled financial services. A Voice Broker is classified as an **Ancillary Service Provider** under the Ancillary Services Framework, not as an FE. Ancillary Service Providers are not eligible for the FinTech Start‑up Grant.  

Hence, a Voice Broker from a FATF high‑risk jurisdiction cannot apply for the FinTech Start‑up Grant.

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 18:
================================================================================
If I apply for an "Accelerator Grant" today, can I use the funds to pay for "Legal Consultancy" services provided by a firm in Mumbai (outside IFSC)?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Yes, but restricted. • Hop 1: Incentive Scheme defines "Accelerator Grant".• Hop 2: FAQs on Milestones lists "Consultancy fees" as permissible.• Hop 3: FE Framework allows sourcing services from outside, BUT...• Hop 4: Payment must be for eligible expenses. If the consultancy is for the project in IFSC, it is reimbursable. The "Mumbai" location is not a hard block for vendors, only for the applicant's registration.

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**Yes.**  

Under the IFSCA FinTech Incentive Scheme, the Accelerator Grant (up to Rs 10 lacs) can be used to reimburse *consultancy fees (legal, technical, compliance)*, as listed in the “Permissible Expenses for Grant Reimbursement” section of the FAQs on Milestones (Part B). The guidance does not restrict the service provider to be located within the IFSC; it simply requires that the expense be a legitimate consultancy fee. Therefore, you may engage a legal consultancy firm based in Mumbai (outside the IFSC) and claim the fees against the Accelerator Grant.

================================================================================
