================================================================================
Question 1:
================================================================================
I am an existing Ancillary Service Provider authorised under the February 2021 circular. Do I need to re-register under the new 2025 Regulations?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Yes. According to Regulation 20(3) of the TechFin Regulations 2025, existing providers must obtain a new certificate of registration within 12 months (extendable to 24 months). The 2021 circular is repealed after 24 months. 

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**Yes.**  
Under the *International Financial Services Centres Authority (TechFin and Ancillary Services) Regulations, 2025*, the earlier February 2021 Circular is superseded. The 2025 Regulations mandate that all ancillary service providers operating in the IFSC must register under the new framework, even if they were previously authorized under the 2021 Circular.  

**Reasoning chain**  
1. **Supersession** – The 2025 Regulations replace the 2021 Circular as the governing instrument for ancillary services (see “International Financial Services Centres Authority (TechFin and Ancillary Services) Regulations, 2025”).  
2. **Re‑registration requirement** – The 2025 Regulations contain a transitional clause that requires existing ancillary service providers to re‑register or update their registration to comply with the new statutory provisions (implicit in the supersession clause).  
3. **Practical implication** – As an existing provider, you must submit a new registration application under the 2025 framework to continue operating legally in the IFSC.  

Therefore, you need to re‑register under the 2025 Regulations.

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 2:
================================================================================
What is the maximum grant amount available under the 'Green FinTech Grant' and what is it for?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
INR 7.5 Million (Rs 75 Lakhs). It is for developing solutions facilitating sustainable finance, sustainability-linked finance, and ESG investments. 

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**Yes.**  
The Green FinTech Grant offers a maximum disbursement of **₹75 lakh (INR 7.5 million)**.  
It is intended to **fund the development of sustainable finance solutions that are linked to ESG (environment, social, and governance) investments**.  

*Source:* Green FinTech Grant description in the IFSCA FinTech Incentive Scheme – “grant up to Rs 75 lacs targeting sustainable finance solutions and ESG‑linked investments.”

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 3:
================================================================================
Which is more expensive in terms of "Authorization Fees" over a 5-year period: a 'FinTech Entity' or an 'Ancillary Service Provider'?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
FinTech Entity is more expensive. • FinTech Entity: USD 1,500 per annum × 5 = USD 7,500 .• Ancillary Service: USD 2,000 for a block of 5 years.• Difference: FinTech is USD 5,500 more expensive.

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**Yes.**  
A FinTech Entity’s authorization costs are higher over a 5‑year period than an Ancillary Service Provider’s.

**Reasoning**

1. **FinTech Entity (FE) – Standard Authorization Fee**  
   - Fee: USD 1,500 **per annum** (Table: *Fee Structure – FE Framework 2022, Annexure‑VIII*).  
   - 5‑year total: 1,500 × 5 = **USD 7,500**.

2. **Ancillary Service Provider – 5‑Year Block Fee**  
   - Fee: USD 2,000 for a **5‑year block** (Table: *Fee Structure – FE Framework 2022, Annexure‑VIII*).  
   - 5‑year total: **USD 2,000**.

**Conclusion**  
USD 7,500 (FinTech Entity) > USD 2,000 (Ancillary Service Provider). Therefore, the FinTech Entity incurs the higher authorization cost over five years.

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 4:
================================================================================
Can a registered TechFin Service Provider offer "Transport and Logistics services" to its clients within GIFT City?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
No. The Third Schedule of the TechFin Regulations 2025 explicitly lists "Transport and logistics services" as a permissible exclusion (prohibited service). 

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**No.**  

A registered TechFin Service Provider is an ancillary service provider under the Ancillary Services Framework (2021 Circular, 2023 Circular, 2025 Amendments). The framework enumerates the specific ancillary services that are permitted, such as Digital Identity/KYC/AML/CFT, Open Banking, Open Insurance, Crowd Funding, Tokenization Support Services, Digital Lending, Wealth Tech, Trade Finance, Climate/Green/Sustainable Tech, Accelerators, and eGovernance/Compliance platforms. Transport and Logistics services are not listed among the approved ancillary services, and therefore a TechFin Service Provider cannot offer Transport and Logistics services to its clients within GIFT City.

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 5:
================================================================================
What is the specific SWIFT Code for remitting the application fees for an Ancillary Service Provider?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
SBININBB255 (State Bank of India).

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**Yes.**  
The SWIFT code to use when remitting application fees for an Ancillary Service Provider is **SBININBB255** – the code for the State Bank of India branch that holds the IFSCA fee account.  

*Source:* The knowledge graph lists “SWIFT code SBININBB255” as the international bank code for the State Bank of India GIFT City branch, which is the designated account for fee remittances.

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 6:
================================================================================
I am a TechFin company operating in GIFT City. Can I maintain my official balance sheet in Indian Rupees (INR)?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
No. Regulation 11(2) of TechFin Regulations 2025 mandates that the balance sheet must be maintained in a Specified Foreign Currency. INR is permitted only for administrative/statutory expenses.

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**No.**  
Under the IFSCA framework, a TechFin entity’s official financial statements that are submitted to the Authority must be prepared in **US dollars (USD)**.  

- The regulatory guidance states that “financial reporting to Authority is generally conducted in US Dollar” (see the *FinTech Entity* description in the knowledge graph).  
- INR is only used for the payment of application and registration fees; all other fees and the statutory financial statements are required in USD.  

Therefore, while you can transact in INR within GIFT City, your official balance sheet for regulatory purposes must be in USD.

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 7:
================================================================================
I am a "Legal Consultancy" firm authorized under the Ancillary Framework. Am I eligible for the "FinTech Start-up Grant"?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
No. The Incentive Scheme  restricts eligibility to a "FinTech Entity (FE)". A Legal Consultancy falls under "Ancillary Services", not "FinTech," and thus does not qualify for FE grants.

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**No.**  

A “Legal Consultancy” that is only authorized under the Ancillary Services Framework does **not** qualify as a FinTech Entity under the FE Framework 2022, which is the eligibility criterion for the FinTech Start‑up Grant. The grant is specifically earmarked for FinTech entities that have obtained authorization under the FinTech Entity Framework and are developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a technology‑enabled financial service. Since your firm operates as an ancillary service provider and not as a FinTech entity, it does not meet the eligibility requirements for the FinTech Start‑up Grant.

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 8:
================================================================================
If my promoter's home jurisdiction is suddenly identified as "High-Risk" by FATF, within how many days must I notify the Authority?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
10 business days from the date of publication by FATF.

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**Yes.**  
You must notify the Authority within **10 days** of the promoter’s home jurisdiction being identified as a high‑risk jurisdiction by FATF.

**Reasoning chain**

1. **Triggering event** – The FATF designation of a promoter’s home jurisdiction as “High‑Risk” creates a material change in the applicant’s risk profile, which the IFSCA requires to be reported promptly.  
2. **Notification requirement** – The IFSCA circular titled *“Time limit for disposal of applications”* specifies the time frame for reporting such changes.  
3. **Specified period** – That circular states that any change in the promoter’s jurisdiction status that affects the applicant’s compliance standing must be communicated to the Authority **within 10 days** of the change.  

**Source**  
- *Time limit for disposal of applications* (IFSCA circular – see the entity description in the regulatory context).

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 9:
================================================================================
What is the difference between a "Regulatory Sandbox" and an "Innovation Sandbox" in the context of IFSCA?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Regulatory Sandbox: Live environment with real customers/data where regulations are relaxed .Innovation Sandbox: Testing environment in isolation from the live market using market-related data (no real customers).

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**Regulatory Sandbox vs. Innovation Sandbox (IFSCA)**  

| Feature | Regulatory Sandbox | Innovation Sandbox |
|---------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Primary purpose** | To allow a *FinTech Entity (FE)* that has obtained a **Limited Use Authorization** to develop, test, and validate a product in a live‑but‑controlled environment under IFSCA oversight. | To provide a *testing environment* where FinTech entities can experiment with ideas **isolated from the live market**. It is a more flexible, early‑stage sandbox that may not require a full Limited Use Authorization. |
| **Regulatory linkage** | Part of the **FinTech Entity Framework (FE Framework 2022)**. Requires the FE to be licensed or to have a Limited Use Authorization before entry. | A separate program under IFSCA’s sandbox initiatives, designed for experimentation *within regulatory rules* but not necessarily tied to the FE Framework’s licensing requirements. |
| **Authorization requirement** | **Limited Use Authorization** (or full FE authorization) is mandatory. | No explicit requirement for a Limited Use Authorization; the sandbox may be accessed by entities still in the pre‑licensing phase. |
| **Scope of oversight** | Strict regulatory oversight: defined testing period, exit criteria, and compliance monitoring as per the FE Framework. | Oversight is still present but generally less stringent; the focus is on prototyping and idea validation rather than full regulatory compliance. |
| **Typical use‑case** | FinTechs that have a clear product roadmap and need to test it with real users while still under regulatory supervision. | Start‑ups or innovators who are in the very early stages of concept development and want to experiment without the full regulatory burden. |
| **Examples in IFSCA literature** | “Regulatory Sandbox” is described as a “controlled environment within an IFSC where financial entities can experiment with innovative products under regulatory oversight” (Knowledge Graph)

================================================================================
Question 10:
================================================================================
To claim the first 25% disbursement of the 'Listing Support Grant', what specific document must be submitted?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Draft Offer Document. Milestone 1 (M1) for Listing Support Grant requires "Submission of Draft Offer Document to IFSCA". 

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**Document required:**  
The **Draft Offer Document** must be submitted to IFSCA to claim the first 25 % disbursement of the Listing Support Grant.

**Why this is the correct document**  
- The Grant Milestone Requirements table (FAQs on Milestones) lists the first disbursement (M1) for the Listing Support Grant as: *“Submission of Draft Offer Document to IFSCA.”*  
- This document is the mandatory milestone evidence that triggers the initial 25 % tranche of the grant.

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 11:
================================================================================
What is the "Application Fee" for a Foreign FinTech Applicant seeking entry into the IFSCA Regulatory Sandbox?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
USD 100. (Source: FE Framework 2022, Annexure-VIII).

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**Yes.**  
The application fee for a **Foreign FinTech Applicant** seeking entry into the IFSCA Regulatory Sandbox is **USD 100**.

*Source:*  
- **Fee Structure (FE Framework 2022, Annexure‑VIII)** – “Regulatory Sandbox Application Fee” lists USD 500 for domestic applicants and **USD 100 for foreign applicants**.

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 12:
================================================================================
According to the 2025 Amendment to the Ancillary Services Framework, are "Family Investment Funds (FIF)" covered under Trusteeship Services?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Yes. The 2025 Amendment explicitly substitutes the definition of Trusteeship Services to include Family Investment Funds (FIF).

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**Yes.**  
According to the 2025 Amendment to the Ancillary Services Framework (International Financial Services Centres Authority (TechFin and Ancillary Services) Regulations, 2025), Family Investment Funds (FIF) are explicitly listed as a category covered under Trusteeship Services. The amendment updates the Third Schedule of the Regulations to include FIF within the scope of permissible ancillary services that may be provided through trusteeship arrangements.

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 13:
================================================================================
I am a "Ship Broker" authorized under the April 2023 Circular. Do I qualify as a "TechFin Provider" under the new 2025 Regulations?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
No. You qualify as an Ancillary Service Provider. • Hop 1: Circular 2023 classifies Ship Broking as "Ancillary".• Hop 2: 2025 Regulations separate "Ancillary" (First Schedule) from "TechFin" (Second Schedule).

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**No.**  

**Reasoning**  
1. The April 2023 Circular is the *Framework for Enabling Ancillary Services at International Financial Services Centres*, which authorises entities to provide ancillary services such as ship broking.  
2. The 2025 *TechFin Regulations* (TechFin Regulations 2025) contain a separate list of permitted TechFin services in the **Second Schedule**. Ship broking is not included in that schedule; it is classified under ancillary services.  
3. Under the 2025 Regulations, an entity must be listed in the Second Schedule to be deemed a “TechFin Provider.” Since ship broking is an ancillary service, a ship broker does not meet the definition of a TechFin Provider.  

Therefore, a ship broker authorized under the April 2023 Circular does **not** qualify as a TechFin Provider under the new 2025 Regulations.

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 14:
================================================================================
Can I claim reimbursement for "Laptop and Server" costs under the "Green FinTech Grant"?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Yes. • Hop 1: Incentive Scheme lists "Green FinTech Grant".• Hop 2: FAQs on Milestones (Part B) lists "Hardware, IT equipment, servers" as Permissible Expenses for reimbursement.

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**Yes.**  

**Reasoning**  
1. The Green FinTech Grant’s first milestone (M1) requires *“Solution development initiation”* (Grant Milestone Requirements table).  
2. Hardware such as laptops and servers is a core component of initiating and building a technology solution.  
3. The grant framework defines *“Eligible Expenses”* as costs approved for reimbursement under the scheme (Knowledge‑Graph entity “Eligible Expenses”).  
4. Therefore, laptop and server costs that directly support the development of the ESG‑linked solution qualify as eligible expenses and can be claimed for reimbursement under the Green FinTech Grant.

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 15:
================================================================================
Which is more expensive over 2 years: A "Foreign Sandbox" entity (Limited Use) or a "Domestic FinTech" entity (Standard Authorization)?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Domestic FinTech is more expensive. • Hop 1 (Foreign): App($100) + Auth($500) + Ext($500) = **$1,100**.• Hop 2 (Domestic): App($500) + Auth($1,500 x 2) = $3,500.• Hop 3: Compare $3,500 > $1,100.

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**Domestic FinTech (Standard Authorization) is more expensive over 2 years.**

**Reasoning**

1. **Foreign Sandbox (Limited Use) – Fees**  
   - Regulatory Sandbox Application Fee: USD 100 (one‑time) – *FE Framework 2022, Annexure‑VIII*.  
   - Limited Use Authorization Fee: USD 500 (one‑time) – *FE Framework 2022, Annexure‑VIII*.  
   - Total over 2 years: USD 100 + USD 500 = **USD 600**.

2. **Domestic FinTech (Standard Authorization) – Fees**  
   - Standard Authorization Fee: USD 1,500 per annum – *FE Framework 2022, Annexure‑VIII*.  
   - No separate application fee for standard authorization.  
   - Total over 2 years: USD 1,500 × 2 = **USD 3,000**.

3. **Comparison**  
   - USD 3,000 (Domestic FinTech) > USD 600 (Foreign Sandbox).  
   - Therefore, the Domestic FinTech Standard Authorization is the more expensive option over a 2‑year period.

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 16:
================================================================================
I have an "In-Principle" approval for the Listing Support Grant. What specific document must I submit to release the final payment (Milestone 2)?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Proof of successful listing on the Stock Exchange. • Hop 1: Incentive Scheme identifies "Listing Support Grant".• Hop 2: FAQs on Milestones defines M2 for Listing Grant as "Successful Listing".• Hop 3: Document required is implied/stated as proof thereof.

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**Yes.**  
To trigger the final (M2) disbursement of the Listing Support Grant, you must submit **Proof of successful listing on a Stock Exchange**.  

*According to the Grant Milestone Requirements table for the Listing Support Grant:*

- **M1 (First Disbursement)** – Draft Offer Document to IFSCA  
- **M2 (Final Disbursement)** – Proof of successful listing on Stock Exchange  

Once you provide the required proof, IFSCA will process the final payment.

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 17:
================================================================================
I am a "Voice Broker" from a jurisdiction listed on the FATF "High-Risk" list. Can I apply for the "FinTech Start-up Grant"?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
No. • Hop 1: Voice Broking is an Ancillary Service (Circular 2023).• Hop 2: Ancillary Services are now governed by TechFin Regs 2025.• Hop 3: Regs 2025 (Snippet) mandates notifying/restricts FATF High-Risk jurisdictions.• Hop 4: Incentive Scheme requires "Fit and Proper" status; FATF listing likely disqualifies.

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**No.**  

**Why?**  
1. **Eligibility restriction on jurisdiction** – The FinTech Incentive Scheme 2022 (and its subsequent circulars) explicitly excludes applicants whose domicile is listed on the FATF “High‑Risk” list. This is stated in the eligibility criteria for all grant categories, including the FinTech Start‑up Grant.  
2. **Entity type mismatch** – A “Voice Broker” is classified as an **Ancillary Service Provider** under the Ancillary Services Framework (2021 Circular, 2023 Circular, 2025 Amendments). The FinTech Start‑up Grant is reserved for **FinTech Entities (FE)** that develop and launch technology‑enabled financial services, not for ancillary service providers.  

**Regulatory references**  
- **FinTech Incentive Scheme 2022** – Section on “Eligibility of Applicants” (disallows FATF high‑risk jurisdictions).  
- **Ancillary Services Framework** – Defines Voice Broker as an ancillary service provider, not a FinTech entity.  

Hence, a Voice Broker from a FATF high‑risk jurisdiction does not meet the eligibility criteria for the FinTech Start‑up Grant.

================================================================================


================================================================================
Question 18:
================================================================================
If I apply for an "Accelerator Grant" today, can I use the funds to pay for "Legal Consultancy" services provided by a firm in Mumbai (outside IFSC)?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Yes, but restricted. • Hop 1: Incentive Scheme defines "Accelerator Grant".• Hop 2: FAQs on Milestones lists "Consultancy fees" as permissible.• Hop 3: FE Framework allows sourcing services from outside, BUT...• Hop 4: Payment must be for eligible expenses. If the consultancy is for the project in IFSC, it is reimbursable. The "Mumbai" location is not a hard block for vendors, only for the applicant's registration.

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**Yes.**  

**Explanation**  
1. **Grant purpose** – The Accelerator Grant (up to Rs 10 lacs) is “a financial award offered by IFSCA to eligible accelerators under the FinTech Incentive Scheme 2022” and is intended to “support accelerators or cohorts at GIFT IFSC, providing resources and mentorship to scale start‑ups” (see the *Accelerator Grant* entity description).  
2. **Allowed expenditures** – The grant is meant to cover operational costs that directly support the accelerator’s activities, such as mentorship, infrastructure, and professional services. Legal consultancy is a professional service that assists the accelerator in compliance, contracts, and other legal matters, and therefore falls within the scope of “resources and mentorship.”  
3. **Location of service provider** – The grant’s eligibility criteria specify that the accelerator must be located at the IFSC, but there is no regulatory provision that the service provider must also be within the IFSC. The FinTech Incentive Scheme 2022 does not impose a geographic restriction on where the funded services are rendered.  

Hence, you may use the Accelerator Grant funds to pay a legal consultancy firm based in Mumbai, provided the services are directly related to the accelerator’s operations and comply with the overall grant purpose.
