================================================================================
Question 3:
================================================================================
Which is more expensive in terms of "Authorization Fees" over a 5-year period: a 'FinTech Entity' or an 'Ancillary Service Provider'?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
FinTech Entity is more expensive. • FinTech Entity: USD 1,500 per annum × 5 = USD 7,500 .• Ancillary Service: USD 2,000 for a block of 5 years.• Difference: FinTech is USD 5,500 more expensive.

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
The **FinTech Entity** incurs higher authorization costs over a 5‑year period.

- **FinTech Entity**: Standard Authorization Fee of USD 1,500 per annum → 5 × 1,500 = USD 7,500 over 5 years.  
- **Ancillary Service Provider**: Ancillary Service Provider fee is a one‑time USD 2,000 for a 5‑year block.

Thus, the FinTech Entity’s authorization fees (USD 7,500) exceed those of an Ancillary Service Provider (USD 2,000) over the same period.

================================================================================
Question 4:
================================================================================
Can a registered TechFin Service Provider offer "Transport and Logistics services" to its clients within GIFT City?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
No. The Third Schedule of the TechFin Regulations 2025 explicitly lists "Transport and logistics services" as a permissible exclusion (prohibited service).

----------------------------------------

================================================================================
Question 6:
================================================================================
I am a TechFin company operating in GIFT City. Can I maintain my official balance sheet in Indian Rupees (INR)?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
No. Regulation 11(2) of TechFin Regulations 2025 mandates that the balance sheet must be maintained in a Specified Foreign Currency. INR is permitted only for administrative/statutory expenses.

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
The IFSCA documents do not contain any explicit requirement that a FinTech entity’s official balance sheet must be prepared in a particular currency.  
The only reference to currency in the framework is that **INR is the Indian Rupee used for application and registration fees; other fees are paid in USD** (Framework for FinTech Entity, Circulars). This indicates that the Authority accepts and operates with INR for its own fee and administrative processes, and there is no prohibition against a FinTech company maintaining its own financial statements in INR.

**Answer:**  
Yes, a TechFin company operating in GIFT City can maintain its official balance sheet in Indian Rupees (INR).

================================================================================
Question 7:
================================================================================
I am a "Legal Consultancy" firm authorized under the Ancillary Framework. Am I eligible for the "FinTech Start-up Grant"?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
No. The Incentive Scheme  restricts eligibility to a "FinTech Entity (FE)". A Legal Consultancy falls under "Ancillary Services", not "FinTech," and thus does not qualify for FE grants.

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
The IFSCA documents do not contain a statement that a legal‑consultancy firm authorized under the Ancillary Framework is eligible for the FinTech Start‑up Grant. The grant is described as being available to FinTech entities, and the documents do not list ancillary service providers (such as legal consultancies) among the eligible applicants.

Question 9:
================================================================================
What is the difference between a "Regulatory Sandbox" and an "Innovation Sandbox" in the context of IFSCA?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Regulatory Sandbox: Live environment with real customers/data where regulations are relaxed .Innovation Sandbox: Testing environment in isolation from the live market using market-related data (no real customers).

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**Regulatory Sandbox**  
- Operates in a **live environment**.  
- Uses **real customers and real data**.  
- Provides regulatory relaxations while the entity interacts with actual market participants.  

**Innovation Sandbox**  
- Operates in an **isolated testing environment**.  
- Uses only **market‑related data**; **no real customers** are involved.  
- Allows experimentation without exposure to live market participants.

Question 12:
================================================================================
According to the 2025 Amendment to the Ancillary Services Framework, are "Family Investment Funds (FIF)" covered under Trusteeship Services?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Yes. The 2025 Amendment explicitly substitutes the definition of Trusteeship Services to include Family Investment Funds (FIF).

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
Yes.  
According to the 2025 Amendment to the Ancillary Services Framework, Family Investment Funds (FIF) are explicitly listed as being covered under Trusteeship Services.

================================================================================
Question 13:
================================================================================
I am a "Ship Broker" authorized under the April 2023 Circular. Do I qualify as a "TechFin Provider" under the new 2025 Regulations?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
No. You qualify as an Ancillary Service Provider. • Hop 1: Circular 2023 classifies Ship Broking as "Ancillary".• Hop 2: 2025 Regulations separate "Ancillary" (First Schedule) from "TechFin" (Second Schedule).

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
No.  
Ship broking is classified as an **ancillary service** under the IFSC framework, not as a TechFin service. The 2025 “International Financial Services Centres Authority (TechFin and Ancillary Services) Regulations” list TechFin services separately, and ship broking is not included in that list. Therefore, a ship broker authorized under the April 2023 Circular does **not** qualify as a TechFin Provider under the new 2025 Regulations.

Question 14:

Yes. • Hop 1: Incentive Scheme lists "Green FinTech Grant".• Hop 2: FAQs on Milestones (Part B) lists "Hardware, IT equipment, servers" as Permissible Expenses for reimbursement.

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:

================================================================================
Question 15:
================================================================================
Which is more expensive over 2 years: A "Foreign Sandbox" entity (Limited Use) or a "Domestic FinTech" entity (Standard Authorization)?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Domestic FinTech is more expensive. • Hop 1 (Foreign): App($100) + Auth($500) + Ext($500) = **$1,100**.• Hop 2 (Domestic): App($500) + Auth($1,500 x 2) = $3,500.• Hop 3: Compare $3,500 > $1,100.

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
**Answer**

Over a 2‑year period, a **Domestic FinTech entity with Standard Authorization** would incur higher fees than a **Foreign Sandbox entity (Limited Use)**.

**Fee comparison**

| Entity type | Relevant fees (USD) | Total over 2 years |
|-------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Foreign Sandbox (Limited Use) | Regulatory Sandbox Application Fee = 100 (one‑time) <br> Limited Use Authorization Fee = 500 (one‑time) | 100 + 500 = **600** |
| Domestic FinTech (Standard Authorization) | Standard Authorization Fee = 1,500 per annum | 1,500 × 2 = **3,000** |

**Conclusion**

The Domestic FinTech Standard Authorization costs **USD 3,000** over two years, which is **more expensive** than the USD 600 cost for a Foreign Sandbox Limited Use entity.

Question 16:
================================================================================
I have an "In-Principle" approval for the Listing Support Grant. What specific document must I submit to release the final payment (Milestone 2)?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Proof of successful listing on the Stock Exchange. • Hop 1: Incentive Scheme identifies "Listing Support Grant".• Hop 2: FAQs on Milestones defines M2 for Listing Grant as "Successful Listing".• Hop 3: Document required is implied/stated as proof thereof.

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
For the Listing Support Grant, the final (Milestone 2) disbursement is released once you provide **proof of successful listing on a Stock Exchange**. This document is the required submission to trigger the final payment.

================================================================================
Question 17:
================================================================================
I am a "Voice Broker" from a jurisdiction listed on the FATF "High-Risk" list. Can I apply for the "FinTech Start-up Grant"?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
No. • Hop 1: Voice Broking is an Ancillary Service (Circular 2023).• Hop 2: Ancillary Services are now governed by TechFin Regs 2025.• Hop 3: Regs 2025 (Snippet) mandates notifying/restricts FATF High-Risk jurisdictions.• Hop 4: Incentive Scheme requires "Fit and Proper" status; FATF listing likely disqualifies.

================================================================================
Question 18:
================================================================================
If I apply for an "Accelerator Grant" today, can I use the funds to pay for "Legal Consultancy" services provided by a firm in Mumbai (outside IFSC)?

----------------------------------------
Expected Answer:
----------------------------------------
Yes, but restricted. • Hop 1: Incentive Scheme defines "Accelerator Grant".• Hop 2: FAQs on Milestones lists "Consultancy fees" as permissible.• Hop 3: FE Framework allows sourcing services from outside, BUT...• Hop 4: Payment must be for eligible expenses. If the consultancy is for the project in IFSC, it is reimbursable. The "Mumbai" location is not a hard block for vendors, only for the applicant's registration.

----------------------------------------
Chatbot Response:
----------------------------------------
Yes.  
The Accelerator Grant is a grant under the FinTech Incentive Scheme 2022 and, according to the FAQs on Milestones – Part B, the following are listed as permissible expenses for reimbursement under all grant categories (including the Accelerator Grant):

- “Consultancy fees (legal, technical, compliance)”

This list does not restrict the location of the service provider. Therefore, legal consultancy services provided by a firm in Mumbai (outside the IFSC) can be paid for with the Accelerator Grant funds.
