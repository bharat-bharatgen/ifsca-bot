- **February 10, 2021**
- **June 10, 2021**

by the International Financial Services Centres Authority for enabling Ancillary Service providers under the 'IFSCA Ancillary Services Framework' in the International Financial Services Centres (IFSCs).

## Background

### Voice Broker Definition

The IFSCA Banking Handbook defines a **voice broker** as:

> "An entity that brings together buyers and sellers of a financial asset for the purpose of executing a transaction in such financial assets."

It permits **IBUs (IFSC Banking Units)** to avail themselves of the services of a voice broker.

Accordingly, voice brokers in IFSC need to be encouraged as a step towards completing the market for intermediaries to provide support services to IBUs and other financial institutions in IFSC. Therefore, it has been decided to enable it under the "IFSCA Ancillary Services Framework".

### Ship Broking

**Ship Broking** is a well-recognized global professional service in the shipping business and **Ship Brokers** are specialist intermediaries in a contract related to Ship leasing business.

The aim of enabling Ship Broking services is to facilitate lessors/lessees to undertake permissible activities as per the framework of Ship Leasing.
